### Description of V1 PoC as Planned by Sprint 10

The initial Proof of Concept (PoC) for our product was planned and executed over the course of 10 sprints, each lasting a week. Key features developed included:

- **User Authentication:**
- **Core Feature Implementation:**
- **Initial UI/UX Design:**
- **Database Integration:**

- **Team Collaboration Challenges:**
Sometimes backend and frontend developers were working on the same part of the app simultaneously. This required great communication skills, since the frontend developer had to adress his needs to the backend one. This resulted to some challenges and delays to greatly coordinate both.
- **Technical Challenges:**
We changed the database that we were using.
- **Performance Metrics:**
