### Description of V1 PoC as Planned by Sprint 10

The initial Proof of Concept (PoC) for our product was planned and executed over the course of 10 sprints, each lasting a week. Key features developed included:

- **User Authentication:**
  We use Google authentication for user login. On their first login, users are required to either choose an existing association to join or create a new one.
- **Core Feature Implementation:** Our app's two main features are managing an association's treasury and overseeing its events. Users can effortlessly create budgets, scan receipts, and record them in the accounting books. Additionally, users can efficiently manage association tasks, view them on a map, and integrate them into their schedule.
- **Initial UI/UX Design:**
  
- **Database Integration:** We use Supabase.
### Learnings from the V1 PoC

- **Team Collaboration Challenges:**
At times, backend and frontend developers were working on the same part of the application simultaneously. This necessitated excellent communication skills, as the frontend developer had to convey their requirements to the backend developer. Thus, coordinating both sides effectively presented some challenges and led to delays.
- **Technical Challenges:**
We switched the database we were using: initially, we started with Firebase, but we quickly transitioned to Supabase. The reason for this change is that Supabase is a relational database, which was essential for our project. In contrast, Firebase uses NoSQL, which does not support relational databases.
- **Performance Metrics:**
