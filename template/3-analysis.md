## Analysis of the Situation

### Competing Products
Currently, there is no centralized app available to manage all aspects of student associations. For example, Agepoly uses Odoo for treasury management and lots of student organizations use Trello for task handling. However, our app, Assocify, combines all the essential features of these apps into one comprehensive solution. Assocify simplifies life for students involved in associations by providing a single app to handle all their needs. With Assocify, they only need to download one app to manage everything efficiently!

### Complementary Products
We could improve our app by adding ticketing services like EventFrog to manage events more efficiently. Additionally, we could integrate cloud storage options like Nextcloud for better file management. Implementing payment solutions through PayPal would also make handling financial transactions easier for our users.
