## Overview

Assocify is a centralized app that streamlines the management of student organizations by offering a one-stop solution for handling accounting, announcements, events, and tasks. With features like receipt scanning, dynamic to-do lists, it simplifies the workload for committee members, ensuring nothing is overlooked.

The app is free for everyone including staffs and members of associations, who are the primary personas for this app.

Our model is to operate Assocify as a "mobile software-as-a-service" with support for Android.
