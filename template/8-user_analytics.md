## User Analytics and Acceptance

Prior to the comprehensive launch of our MVP (Minimum Viable Product), it's crucial that we establish and deploy a system to gather pertinent data on user interaction with our application. This will enable us to pinpoint areas for enhancement and rectify any issues.

### Key Metrics
- **Active Users:** Daily and monthly active users to gauge overall app engagement and retention.
- **User Retention Rate:** Percentage of users who return to the app within specific time frames, which indicates the app's engagement.
- **Conversion Rate:** Ratio of users who complete desired actions (e.g., signing up for an event, submitting budgets) versus total users, to determine the app's effectiveness in driving user actions.
- **Session Length:** Average time a user spends in the app per session, which helps measure user engagement.
- **Feature Usage:** Frequency and manner in which specific features are used, highlighting the most and least popular features, to help inform future feature developement.
- **Net Promoter Score:** Asking users to rate their likelihood to recommend the app on a scale of 0-10, to gauge user satisfaction.


### Success Criteria
- **User Growth:** Achieve a steady month-over-month increase in user numbers, targeting a growth percentage of 10% per month initially.
- **Engagement Metrics:** Maintain an average session length and acheive a user retention rate of at least 50% initially.
- **Satisfaction Levels:** Achieve an average net promoter score of 5 or higher.
- **Feature Adoption:** Ensure key features reach a minimum of 70% target users engaging with them in the first 3 months of their release.

### Analysis Plan
**1. Data Collection**

- Utilize Supabase Reports and Metrics to gather data on user interactions and app performance.

- Implement custom event tracking to capture detailed metrics beyond built-in data collection, including specific feature usage and conversion actions.

- Ensure data collection is compliant with privacy standards by anonymizing data and removing any sensitive information.

**2. Data Analysis**

- Conduct regular data analysis to monitor trends and identify areas for improvement.

- Use behavioral analysis to understand usage patterns and the impact of new features or updates.

- Perform event analysis to identify drop-off points in user journeys and optimize conversion rates.

**3. Report**

- Visualize key metrics and track progress towards success criteria.

- Generate periodic reports to guide decision-making.

### A/B Testing Ideas
- Test various ways of grouping functionalities into tabs and ordering them, to find the most user-friendly navigation structure.
- Experiment with different homepage layouts, including different information categories to display and different display formats, to indentify the most engaging design.
- Assess the impact of placing key features in various locations within the app to optimize ease of use.
- Try various entry flows (login in, requesting access to an association / creating an association, etc) to determine what best helps users understand and navigate into the app
