## User Analytics and Acceptance

### Goal
- **Objective:** To comprehensively understand how users are interacting with the app, identify patterns of usage, and measure satisfaction and performance against set objectives.

### Key Metrics
- **Active Users:** Daily and monthly active users to gauge overall app engagement and retention.
- **User Retention Rate:** Percentage of users who return to the app within a certain time frame, which indicates the app's value to users.
- **Conversion Rate:** Ratio of users who complete desired actions (e.g., signing up for an event, submitting budgets) versus total visitors.
- **Session Length:** Average time a user spends in the app per session, which helps measure user engagement.
- **Feature Usage:** Frequency and manner in which specific features are used, highlighting the most and least popular features.

### Success Criteria
- **User Growth:** Achieve a steady month-over-month increase in user numbers by 10%.
- **Engagement Metrics:** Maintain an average session length of over 3 minutes and increase user retention rate by 20% within six months.
- **Satisfaction Levels:** Achieve an average user satisfaction score of at least 4 out of 5 based on user feedback surveys.

### Analysis Plan
- **Data Collection Methods:**
  - Utilize integrated analytics tools within the app, such as Google Analytics for mobile, to automatically track and report on user behavior and app performance.
  - Implement custom event tracking to capture interactions with specific features and functionalities.
- **Data Analysis Techniques:**
  - Regularly analyze data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
  - Use statistical methods and data visualization tools to present findings to product owners.

### A/B Testing Ideas
