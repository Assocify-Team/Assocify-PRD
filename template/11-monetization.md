## Business Model

Our product's goal is to become the "default" application to manage anything and everything related to associations. As such, our clients will be organizations or administrations, rather than the users themselves. The app will also grow in jumps, rather than a regular curve of users, as entire associations join at once. As such, we propose a 1-month trial period followed by a monthly subscription paid by the association. The subscription price will be based on the number of members of the association. For larger institutions (such as EPFL itself), a yearly subscription can provide free access to all included associations.

Once an association has joined, we hope to keep them locked in through convenience and centralization; having a phone app makes it easier for all the users, who will complain to the administration if it moves to another service. Additionally, moving over a large amount of data from several years is difficult, and becomes more difficult the longer an association is a customer.

To increase our target market, we can also expand to companies and other institutions, though this would require market research and possibly a more convenient administrative platform, such as a website.

### Expected Operating Costs

  - Software Development: $50'000 (one person-year of development, for refinement and added requirements)
- **Operational Costs:**
  - Hosting and Servers: $1'000 (with large margin)
- **Marketing and Sales:**
  - Advertising: N/A. Because of our target market, most advertising will initially be done through cold calls and direct presentations to administrations.
- **Administrative Costs:**
  - Legal and Licensing: $5'000 (consultation with a lawyer to understand our legal responsibilities)
- **Total Expected Operating Costs:**
  - First Year Total: $60'000 (added margin)

### Revenue Streams
- **Product Sales:**
  - Direct sales through website and mobile app.
  - Pricing Model: Subscription-based, $5/month/member or $50/year/member.
  

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
  - Target CAC of $1'000 at most per paying organization.
- **Lifetime Value (LTV):**
  - Estimated LTV of $12'500 based on average subscription duration of 5 years, for an organization of 50 members.
- **Churn Rate:** 20% including for organizations that dissolve

### Risk Analysis
- **Market Risks:** To our knowledge, no other product aims for the niche of administration for small organizations. However, it is possible that a product previously targeted towards administration of large organizations expands to target smaller ones, and thanks to experience and momentum gains market share more easily.
- **Operational Risks:** Possible tech debt, inexperience
- **Financial Risks:** The initial, 1-year cost being rather low, there are not many financial risks.
